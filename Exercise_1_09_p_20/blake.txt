The Shepered
	    
How  sweet    is  the      Shepherds  sweet    lot,
From  the      morn  to  the    evening    he   strays:
He     shall    follow   his  sheep    all   the  day
And   his    tongue  shall  be     filled   with  praise.
	
For  he    hears   the  lambs   innocent  call,
And  he   hears    the  ewes  tender    reply,
He    is    watchful   while   they   are  in  peace,
For   they    know    when  their  Shepherd  is  nigh.
	
Willian  Blake  (Songs  of  Innocence  and  Experience).
