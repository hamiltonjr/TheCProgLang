# TheCProgLang

This is a small exercise solving project for the book The C Programming Language, written by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. Ir was a dream for me to solve that exercises. This project is a conquer.

Each exercise is a folder. It looks needed because some exercises are due in a sufficient big number of files to want organize it in a folder.

The identification of folders is Exercise_chapter_number_p_page. It maintains all the folders in order in a unique parent folder.
