This project, without the right generallity, has a problem. When 
the plain text has a slash \, it is converted for \\... ok. But
if after this slashes it has a 't' for example ('n' also bring 
problems), for unescape one slash joints with 't' and compounds
a tab. 

It only can be solved with a serious analusys of text. It looks
beyond the scope of this homework. Then, I wrote the code like
it is, simple. It converts almost all texts without problem: it
only when this cases occurs that problems must be faced.
