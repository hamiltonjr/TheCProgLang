Exercise 3-3. Write a function expand (s 1, s2) that 
expands shorthand notations like a-z in the string s1 
into the equivalent complete list abc...xyz in s2. 
Allow for letters of either case and digits, and be 
prepared to handle cases like a-b-c and a-zO-9 and 
-a-z. Arrange that a leading or trailing - is taken 
literally.
