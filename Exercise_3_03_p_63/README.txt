I didn't understand what authors was want to say with:
"Arrange that a leading or trailing - is taken literally".

For me, it looks to be:
        -z = a-z, a- = a-z, 1- = 1-9, etc.
                       or
     leading and trailing - is taken like errors.

I chose ths second interpretation because it looks logic to me.
But I can be wrong.
